        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> The designers at Lamborgani are reconciling tradition and modernity in designing the cars for the future. Their work centres on “Sensual Purity” as an expression of modern luxury. The new design idiom featuring reduced edges and creases – indentations and recesses in the sheet metal – aims to create clear forms and sensual surfaces which showcase high tech while also arousing emotions.These cars are made for racing and are found at racetracks or racing circuits rather than on the street. </p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> The first racing cars were motorized versions of horse-drawn carriages and wagons. The first race was a reliability demonstration from Chicago to Waukegan, Illinois, in November 1895, while the first American oval-track race, held at the Rhode Island State Fairgrounds in Cranston in 1896, was won at an average speed of 43.1 km/h. Racing in the United States became popular two years later, with the opening of 4-km brick-surfaced Indianapolis Motor Speedway.Formula racing, which is governed by FIA, is involved. The organization is located in Paris, France.</p>
